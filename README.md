# Project 2

This web application is about real time communication. This allows users sending messages to one another in real time, they have no need to reload the page to see messages sent to the group. All messages and other information related to messages are saved in a variable that appears to be in the server side. In other words, when the server dies all information will be gone. 


set FLASK_APP as application1.py (application.py may not work)
then run -> flask run
at the end on you will be provided the URL to go to via which browser you want

To run web application, on the command line do those:
1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. go to Repository directory you cloned
3. set FLASK_APP=application1.py (hit the enter)
4. set FLASK_DEBUG=1 (hit the enter)
5. flask run
6. copy url (presumably http://127.0.0.1:5000 ) and paste the browser to open web application.
